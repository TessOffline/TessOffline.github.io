        <p>Local bird known as Wojtek went crazy when he flew down to the local mall and started
            <em>attacking</em> the shoppers. A person named Alexandra got <i>pecked</i> on the head while
            she was at the grocery store. <q>"The bird was pecking me and grabbing me by the hair!"</q>
            said Alexandra. <blockquote>"I was screaming as I tried to run away from it and call animal 
            control, <b>I was scared for my life!</b>"</blockquote>
